             Winged Monkey is a concept for a user portal backed by a cloud provider.  It offers simplified interactions for non-administrative users, with some specific goals:
           </p>
           <ul>
             <li>Browse a list of applications that the user can launch</li>
             <li>Launch an application with the minimum necessary steps</li>
             <li>See the status of applications which the user has launched</li>
             <li>Terminate an application that the user has launched</li>
           </ul>
         </div>
